<h1>Keeping Safe At Restaurants </h1>

<p>
The more you interact with others and the longer you interact with them the higher your risk<br>
of COVID-19 infection. In line with the latest guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health <br>
and Rwanda Biomedical Centre related to COVID-19, several precautions have been adopted to <br>
minimize the risk of infection. Restaurants and cafe shall operate at 50% occupancy limit<br>
and shall receive clients until 10pm and advised to encourage their clients and staff to <br>
adhere to required COVID-19 prevention measures (e.g., required masks, hand washing, <br>
social distancing, health screening and documentation of staff and clients, etc.)<br><br>
</p>
